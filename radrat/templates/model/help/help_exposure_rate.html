				<h1 class="page-title">Guidance for Selecting Exposure Rate</h1>
				<p>Each exposure can be defined as acute or chronic. Based on this input information, the calculator determines whether to adjust the risk estimates by a "dose and dose-rate effectiveness factor" (DDREF). Since most underlying risk models in NCI RadRAT are based on studies of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors who were exposed to a short-term/acute radiation dose, the models are adjusted by the DDREF when applied to longer-term (chronic) exposures. This adjustment accounts for the possibility that the risk from chronic exposures is different than the risk observed from acute exposures.</p>		
				<p>To classify each exposure as acute or chronic, one can rely on the criteria recommended by the UNSCEAR (2003): chronic exposures are those where the dose rate is lower than 6 mGy per hour averaged over the first few hours. This recommendation was adopted by Land et al., (2003) and is similar to that of EPA (1999).</p>        
				<p><b>In general, an exposure received over a short period of time (less than 1 day) may be considered acute, while prolonged (or repeated) exposures that span more than 1 day may be considered chronic.</b></p>
