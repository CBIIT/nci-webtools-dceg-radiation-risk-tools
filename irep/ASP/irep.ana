Title: Number of radon exposures
Description: Number of discrete exposures to radon, assumed to occur on an annual basis; however, multiple exposures can be entered for the same year. For exposures that occur within seven years of the year of diagnosis of lung cancer, the ERR is reduced due to the effect of a latency period. For exposures that occur within 2 years of the year of diagnosis, the ERR is reduced to zero.~
~
If the number of exposures is set to 1, and the "type" of exposure in "Radon Exposure Information" table is set to "Total", then the specified value of WLM represents the cumulative exposure over all years, and no latency effect is taken into account.

Description: This node adjusts the original ERR/Sv for for the LSS cohort (corrected for random and systematic errors in dosimetry) for differences in background cancer incidence rates between the Japanese and U.S. populations.~
~
The adjustment is performed using a linear mixture of the additive and multiplicative interactions between radiation exposure and backround incidence rates, with the extent of mixture (W_tr) treated as an uncertain variable.  ~
~
The additive model is directly dependent on the ratio of the background incidence rates of the Japanese to that of the US population, while the multiplicative model is independent of the differences in background rates.~

Variable W_tr
Title: Model mixture factor (W_tr)
Description: The model mixture factor accounts for the fact that a true relationship between radiation induced cancer and differences in background incidence rates among different populations is uncertain.~
~
This factor allows for model combinations to occur between a purely additive (the ERR/Sv is dependent on background incidence rates) and a purely multiplicative relationship (the ERR/Sv is independent of background incidence rates).~
~
Because the limits of the model mixture factor are less than 0 and greater than 1,  the possibility of sub-additive and super- multiplicative relationships are included.~
~
The model weighting factor is used for determining the linear combination of models~
~

~
This Table was modified on June 3, 2003 to reflect the new lung model proposed by NCI (Data of May 15, 2003).~

Chance X_smoking
Title: Smoking mixture factor
Description: The mixture factor (x) is used to account for combinations of the interaction between radiation and smoking history.  The uncertainty in the mixture factor is described as a triangular distribution.~
~
This distribution allows the ERR/Sv for lung cancer to range from an additive interaction (x = 0) to a multiplicative interaction (x = 1).~
~
A weight of 50 % is assigned to the additivity, and  the rest of 50% is assigned to a triangular distribution with a minimum at 0 (additive) , a mode  at 1.0 (multiplicative), and with a probability of about .10 for a super-multiplicative interaction (x > 1).~
~
On 8/20/2004, the weight of 50% to the additive model was removed for alpha particles and applies only for gammas, electrons, and neutrons of all energies.

Variable Err_sv_us_p
Title: ERR/Sv (Extrapolated to the U.S. population) percentiles
Description: This node adjusts the original ERR/Sv for for the LSS cohort (corrected for random and systematic errors in dosimetry) for differences in background cancer incidence rates between the Japanese and U.S. populations.~
~
The adjustment is performed using a linear mixture of the additive and multiplicative interactions between radiation exposure and backround incidence rates, with the extent of mixture (W_tr) treated as an uncertain variable.  ~
~
The additive model is directly dependent on the ratio of the background incidence rates of the Japanese to that of the US population, while the multiplicative model is independent of the differences in background rates.~

Title: Te1
Description: NOTE:~
~
These nodes describe the procedure used to correlate ERR/Sv values for specific exposure periods to properly estimate the total ERR for an individual with multiple exposures.~
~
The correlation between the ERR/Sv for specific exposure periods is obtained by matching the rank order of the value sampled for the first exposure period to the rank order sampled for all subsequent exposure periods.

Title: Sorted distr
Description: Sort all exposure distributions from low to high - this is essentially the equivalent of forcing them to be correlated.~

Variable Err_sv_original
Title: Original ERR/Sv from LSS (truncated)
Description: This node contains the truncated cumulative distribution function of the original ERR/Sv, adjusted for the effects of an initial latency period.~
~
The ERR/Sv for thyroid cancer is based on exposure to x-rays. Therefore, it is divided by the radiation effectiveness factor relative to high energy gamma rays. The result is compatible with an ERR/Sv from exposures to high energy gamma rays. (Removed on 3/19/04)~
~
The effectiveness of xrays is thought to be eliminated because of the low effectiveness of fractionated exposures.~

As described in presentation made to the NIOSH advisory board (May 2003).

Relative Risk~
(sources other than radon)
Description: This node calculates the excess relative risk for a specific exposure period.~
~
For leukemias (all types), in the case of acute exposure to low-LET radiation, the dose response obtained from the epidemiological data is quadratic. Therefore, the ERR is calculated by multiplying the final adjusted ERR/Sv coefficients by [dose*(1+dose)].~
~
For all other cancer types, radiation types and exposure rates, the dose response is linear.  Therefore, the final adjusted ERR/Sv coefficients are multiplied directly by the dose to obtain the ERR.

~
This step takes into account additional uncertainties associated with RBE for a given type of radiation.  The equivalent dose (cSv) provided by the user is used to obtain an absorbed dose (cGy), which is further multiplied by an uncertain RBE for different radiation types.~
~
The factor of 100 converts cSv to Sv.

Variable Err_other
Title: Excess~
Relative Risk~
(sources other than radon)
Description: This node calculates the excess relative risk for a specific exposure period.~
~
For leukemias (all types), in the case of acute exposure to low-LET radiation, the dose response obtained from the epidemiological data is quadratic. Therefore, the ERR is calculated by multiplying the final adjusted ERR/Sv coefficients by [dose*(1+dose)].~
~
For all other cancer types, radiation types and exposure rates, the dose response is linear.  Therefore, the final adjusted ERR/Sv coefficients are multiplied directly by the dose to obtain the ERR.

Description: Enter the organ dose in cSv for the site in which the cancer has been diagnosed. ~
~
IREP allows the organ dose to be entered either as a point estimate (single value) or as an uncertain value (represented as a probability distribution).~
~
If more than one exposure was received, enter the dose for each individual exposure period.  Numerous individual exposures (less than 1 cSv) within one year can be considered as a chronic exposure (equal to a sum of the individual exposures) for that year.~
~
Use the dose to the red bone marrow for the following diseases:  Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL), Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), Chronic  Myelogenous Leukemia (CML), other leukemias, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), and Multiple Myeloma. If the external dose to the salivary gland is not available, the dose to the skin can be used instead.  For all other cancers, use the dose specific to that organ.~

Title: Te20
Description: In IREP, doses that are uncertain are represented as probability distributions.  These probability distributions represent the state of knowledge about the true but unknown organ dose for an individual who has been diagnosed with cancer.~
~
The distributions are made up of alternative realizations of true but unknown doses.  These distributions may be obtained either from a statistical summarization of dose measurements or through the use of expert judgement (based on subjective analysis of available information about the conditions under which the individual was exposed).~
~
NCRP Commentary No. 14 (1996) can be consulted for additional information on the use of expert judgement to obtain subjective probability distributions for true but unknown quantities.~
~
The lognormal is the most common distribution used to capture the state of knowledge about an uncertain dose.  Other distributions are provided to give the user additional options for capturing the state of knowledge about an uncertain dose. Double-click on the distribution of interest for additional instructions.

Title: Lognormal
Description: The lognormal distribution is defined as the exponential of a normal distribution of logtransformed values.  The lognormal distribution is among the most common used in quantitative uncertainty analysis and is usually the product of numerous underlying uncertain variables.~
~
In IREP, the lognormal distribution is determined by two parameters, the median (or geometric mean) and the geometric standard deviation (gsdev).~
~
To apply the lognormal distribution, type the following syntax in the table of dose input information:~

Title: Normal
Description: The normal distribution is usually obtained from a statistical analysis of measurements.  The limits of a normal distribution are plus and minus infinity.~
~
The user is cautioned about the possibility of generating negative values of dose when the standard deviation exceeds 25% of the mean.  Because negative values of dose are not possible, if the uncertainty in dose is large, the user should consider the choice of an alternative distribution, such as a lognormal.~
~
In IREP, the normal distribution is determined by two parameters, the mean and the standard deviation (stddev).~

Title: Lognormal
Description: The lognormal distribution is defined as the exponential of a normal distribution of logtransformed values.  The lognormal distribution is among the most common used in quantitative uncertainty analysis and is usually the product of numerous underlying uncertain variables.~
~
In IREP, the lognormal distribution is determined by two parameters, the median (or geometric mean) and the geometric standard deviation (gsdev).~
~
To apply the lognormal distribution, type the following syntax in the table of dose input information:~
~
     Lognormal (median, gsdev)~

Chance Normal_example1
Title: Normal
Description: The normal distribution is usually obtained from a statistical analysis of measurements.  The limits of a normal distribution are plus and minus infinity.~
~
The user is cautioned about the possibility of generating negative values of dose when the standard deviation exceeds 25% of the mean.  Because negative values of dose are not possible, if the uncertainty in dose is large, the user should consider the choice of an alternative distribution, such as a lognormal.~
~
In IREP, the normal distribution is determined by two parameters, the mean and the standard deviation (stddev).~

Title: Te15
Description: The assigned share is the fraction of cancers observed in a large and heterogeneous group, having similar exposure histories, that might not have occurrred in the absence of exposure.  This is an actuarial concept that may be applied to individuals for the adjudication of claims.  In IREP, the assigned share is estimated with uncertainty, expressed as a probability distribution.~
~
 - The first button presents a table of selected cumulative probabilities of~
    assigned share to represent uncertainty in this quantity.~
~
 - The second button presents a printable summary table containing pertinent input~
    information and results.~
~
The fractional assigned share is presented as a percentage. For example, an assigned share of 10% means that 10% of the cancers in a heterogeneous group would be caused by their exposure. An assigned share greater than 50% implies that a randomly chosen cancer in a heterogeneous group is more likely than not to have been caused by the exposure.

Description: This step allows the user to examine the model components that dominate the uncertainty in the calculation of assigned share.~
~
The top button identifies the importance of radon sources vs. other sources. It also includes the effects of the user defined additional uncertainty factor.~
~
The first button on the left compares the importance of the adjusted ERR/Gy, the RBE for specific radiation types, and the dose to the overall uncertainty in the calculated assigned share.~
~
The second button identifies the important model components that contribute to the overall uncertainty in the adjusted ERR/Gy.~
~
The button on the right reports the  breakdown of uncertainties for the radon model.~
~
Obtaining additional information on those model components that dominate the uncertainty in the calculation of assigned share is an efficient means of improving the overall confidence in the calculation.
